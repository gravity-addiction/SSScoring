    "SSScoring provides analsysis tools for individual or bulk processing of FlySight GPS competition data gathered during speed skydiving training and competition.  Scoring methodology adheres to International Skydiving Commission (ISC), International Speed Skydiving Association (ISSA), and United States Parachute Association (USPA) published competition and scoring rules.  SSScoring libraries and tools also operate with track data files produced by these devices:\n",
