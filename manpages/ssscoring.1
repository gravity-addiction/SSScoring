SSScoring processes all FlySight files (tagged as v1 or v2, depending on
the device) and SkyTrax files.
It aggregates and summarizes the results.
Full API documentation is available at:
.PP

.SH Quickstart
.PP
Coming soon.
.SH Description
.PP
SSScoring provides analsysis tools for individual or bulk processing of
FlySight GPS competition data gathered during speed skydiving training
and competition.
Scoring methodology adheres to International Skydiving Commission (ISC),
International Speed Skydiving Association (ISSA), and United States
Parachute Association (USPA) published competition and scoring rules.
Though FlySight is the only Speed Measuring Device (SMD) accepted by all
these organizations, SSScoring libraries and tools also operate with
track data files produced by these devices:
.IP \[bu] 2
FlySight 1
.IP \[bu] 2
FlySight 2
.IP \[bu] 2
SkyTrax GPS and barometric device
.PP
SSScoring leverages data manipulation tools in the pandas and NumPy data
analysis libraries.
All the SSScoring code is written in pure Python, but the implementation
leverages libraries that may require native code for GPU and AI chipset
support like Nvidia and M-chipsets.
.SS Features
.IP \[bu] 2
Pure Python
.IP \[bu] 2
Supports output from FlySight versions v1 and v2, and SkyTrax devices
.IP \[bu] 2
Automatic file version detection
.IP \[bu] 2
Bulk file processing via data lake scanning
.IP \[bu] 2
Automatic selection of FlySight-like files mixed among files of multiple
types and from different applications and operating systems
.IP \[bu] 2
Individual file processing
.IP \[bu] 2
Automatic jump file validation according to competition rules
.IP \[bu] 2
Automatic skydiver exit detection
.IP \[bu] 2
Automatic jump scoring with robust error detection based on exit
altitude, break off altitude, scoring window, and validation window
.IP \[bu] 2
Produces time series dataframes for the speed run, summary data in
5-second intervals, scoring window, speed skydiver track angle with
respect to the ground, horizontal distance from exit, etc.
.IP \[bu] 2
Reports max speed, exit altitude, scoring window end, distance traveled
from exit, and other data relevant to competitors during training
.IP \[bu] 2
Internal data representation includes SI and Imperial units;
implementers may choose either one when working with the API
.PP
The latest SSScoring API is available on GitHub:
https://pr3d4t0r.github.io/SSScoring/ssscoring.html
.PP
The SSScoring package can be installed into any Python environment
version 3.9 or later.
https://pypi.org/project/ssscoring
.PP
SSScoring also includes Jupyter notebooks for dataset exploratory
analysis and for code troubleshooting.
Unit test coverage is greater than 92%, limited only by Jupyter-specific
components that can\[cq]t be tested in a standalone environment.
.SS What is a data lake?
.PP
A \f[B]data lake\f[R] is a files repository that stores data in its raw,
unprocessed form.
A speed skydiving data lake often has one or more of these types of
files:
.IP \[bu] 2
FlySight versions 1 or 2 files
.IP \[bu] 2
SkyTrax files
.IP \[bu] 2
Video files (MP4 or MOV of whatever)
.IP \[bu] 2
PDFs of meet bulletins and related event information
.IP \[bu] 2
Miscellaneous other junk
.PP
SSScoring identifies FlySight and SkyTrax files regardless of what other
file types are available in the data lake.
SSScoring also identifies speed files from other types of tracks
(e.g.\ wingsuit) based on the performance profile and scoring windows.
Tell the SSScoring tools where to get all the track files, even if they
are several levels deep in the directory structure, and SSScoring will
find, validate, and score only the speed skydiving files regardless of
what else is available in the data lake.
The only limitation is available memory.
SSScoring has been tested with as many as 467 speed files during a
single run, representing all the training files for a competitive
skydiver over 10 months.
.SS Additional tools
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]nospot\f[R] shell script for disabling Spotlight scanning of
FlySight file file systems
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]umountFlySight\f[R] Mac app and shell script for safe unmounting of
a FlySight device from a Macintosh computer
